 WARNING: for raster artwork formats, artwork accuracy must be
  at least one place greater than the database accuracy, up
  to the maximum accuracy allowed by the selected output format.

  Increase the accuracy by increasing the "Decimal Places" in
  the FORMAT section of the artwork parameters and then rerun
  artwork.

  The current output is rounding down the data.  Failure to change
  the format may result in inaccurate arc coordinates in the output
  files and possible shape/void plotting failures.
